Day17

July 7th

Today I have learned the javascript topic Event loops. After that, I started redesigning the calculator made in javascript. For this, I needed to change the names of classes
and give to each element again. Will deploy the completed project tomorrow morning as some work is needed to be done in CSS of the project.
