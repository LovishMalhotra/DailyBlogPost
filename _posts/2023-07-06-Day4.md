Day 4 
July 6th Time Tracked 8:30:00
I have started with learning React modules that were left. 
I started with the spread operator module in which the first lesson was a lesson about the topic and then there was a challenge given by course instructor Angela. I have used Sandbox for writing react code.
After completing the spread module I started with the component trees topic. First, there was 20 min topic overview after that challenge was there. Done that in the sandbox as well.
It was challenging for me to understand such advanced topics although I have done the same. 
I am done with my react modules today and now looking forward to doing projects.
