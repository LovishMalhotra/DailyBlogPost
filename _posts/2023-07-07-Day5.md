Day5 

July 7th

Today I have started with learning advanced concepts of javascript. In the course, video I have learned javascript ES6 features such as:
  * var, const, let keywords
  * Arrow functions
  * object destructuring
  * spread operators
  * Exports
I was familiar with javascript but was lacking in advanced concepts of javascript. Today I have done some of them as well.

I have also begun to do react calculator project but I was not able to complete it for now. I will complete the project by tomorrow morning.
